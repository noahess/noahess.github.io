What would an electrified 767 look like? A simple first-order analysis of a potential new market.
<!--more-->

# Overview
The late 2010s have been increasingly exciting for those watching electric aviation, especially 2019 in review. 
This past year has seen the first all-electric airline commitment [^1] and success [^2]; Boeing partnering with Kitty Hawk — an electric airframer[^3]; and delivery of NASA’s electric X-57, the agency’s first crewed X-plane in two decades[^4].
With this fast pace, when should we start seeing electric aircraft take over the skies?

To begin our analysis, we will need to set some rules and assumptions. 
We’re not looking to completely upend the aviation industry, so we will simply study a re-configured existing airframe (sorry, fans of blended wing bodies). 
We will also only look at the very surface level of design, a first-order approach. 
This article is not intended to be a comprehensive study, only a look at a potential new industry. 
I will follow this general plan for the analysis:

1. Generate design concept
2. Estimate airframe weights
3. Investigate how airlines actually use the 767-300 and estimate aero properties
4. Estimate and refine propulsion requirements
5. Calculate required engine & battery sizing
6. Forecast the value of this project to important stakeholders

# Design Concept
Neither Boeing nor Airbus will probably introduce an electric aircraft into the 737/A320 market space first as the large quantity demanded will introduce too much risk for a groundbreaking design.
Exceptionally large aircraft like the A380, 747, or 777X make money for airlines on long-haul routes where the energy density of batteries may become an issue.

A medium-range and medium-capacity aircraft designed for a small market is the perfect target for introducing new technology: the small market allows low-rate and low-risk manufacturing, the larger fuselage compared to a small aircraft can hold more volume of batteries, and the medium-range shouldn’t be too demanding.
This is called the Middle of the Market (MoM) and is currently served on the lower end by A321 XLR’s and 757s, and on the upper end by 767s, 787–8s, and A330s.

We will look at the 767–300, a highly capable and relatively light aircraft in the upper end of the MoM.
It’s unlikely an electric aircraft could match the range of the 767 (6,876 miles)[^5], so we will only consider flights up to 6.5 hours and total range of 3,500 miles.
This falls just short of the 737 MAX family with ranges at maximum payload between 4,100 miles to 4,400 miles[^6] but serves the entire continental United States, most or all of China from Beijing to Chengdu, and all western Europe.
This will severely limit the market size; however, unit pricing and lease rates may allow direct competition with small aircraft.

# Weights

All commercial aircraft specify a Maximum Take-off Weight (\\(\text{MTOW}\\)) and a Maximum Landing Weight (\\(\text{MLW}\\)), with \\(\text{MTOW}>\text{MLW}\\).
The  of the 767–300 is listed as 145.5t (metric tons) with an Operating Empty Weight (\\(\text{OEW}\\)) of 88t[^7].
According to the FAA, the average weight of passengers is 190 lb in the summer and 195 lb in the winter, or just under 90 kg[^8], with EASA reporting a standard deviation of 17.7 kg.
EASA also reports an average mass of checked baggage at roughly 16 kg with a standard deviation of 5.7 kg[^9].
We will assume half of all passengers will check 1 bag as these flights will be mostly 4 hours long or less.
The total weight addition due to \\(N\\) many passengers is then 

$$(N\times 100\\%\times 90 \text{kg}) + (N \times 50\\% \times 16 \text{kg}) = N × 96 \text{kg}$$

with standard deviation 

$$\sqrt{N\times 100\\% \times (17.7\text{kg})^2 + N \times 50\\% \times (5.7\text{kg})^2}=\sqrt{N}\times 18.2\text{kg}$$

We want to size for the worst-case scenario, so pick the 6-sigma loading scenario:

$$W=N\times 96\text{kg} + \sqrt{N}\times 109.2\text{kg}$$

We will break down the weight of the aircraft using an estimate provided by Jacob Markish in his Master’s
Thesis[^10]:
![Weight Breakdown from Markish](/images/767e/weight_breakdown.png)

Boeing claims to have achieved a 20% weight reduction for comparable parts by moving to Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) on the 787 Dreamliner [^11].
Assuming the fuselage, wing, wing box, and empennage can be made out of CFRP on our aircraft, that results in a weight of
$$25\\% + (23\\% \times 80\\%) + (3\\% \times 80\\%) + (23\\% \times 80\\%) + 8\\% = 72\\% \times \text{OEW of 767} = 63.5\\text{t}$$
...ignoring the engines. The total amount of weight remaining for engines and batteries is now
$$\text{MLW} - \text{Passenger Weight} − \text{OEW of new design} = 82\text{t} – N\times 96\text{kg} + \sqrt{N}\times 109.2\text{kg}$$

# Flight Performance
Thanks to FlightAware, we can find real-world data of how 767–300s are used in service.
Out of 200 flights available on FlightAware, 105 are regularly scheduled passenger flights.
Of the 105 regularly scheduled passenger flights, 55 are less than 6.5 hours in duration.
Of the 55 routes meeting our mission design, 224 flights from the following 48 routes were analyzed:

| Flights |         |         |         |         |         |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| AAL1285 | AJX873  | DAL1115 | ETH407  | ROU1507 | ROU1852 |
| AAL1307 | AJX923  | DAL154  | ICE614  | ROU1606 | ROU1853 |
| AAL918  | AJX934  | DAL180  | ICE630  | ROU1608 | ROU1944 |
| AAL927  | AJX948  | DAL184  | JAL812  | ROU1628 | TAM3154 |
| ACA125  | ANA8421 | DAL2201 | JAL860  | ROU1653 | TAM8001 |
| ACA908  | ANA8558 | DAL427  | JAL913  | ROU1659 | UAL1960 |
| AJX812  | ANG392  | DAL468  | JAL917  | ROU1715 | UZB603  |
| AJX834  | DAE1    | DAL975  | KTK7705 | ROU1813 | WJA2311 |

767–300 flights below 6.5 hours in duration appear to follow a bimodal distribution for both total distance traveled and time spent in flight.
Furthermore, it appears our cutoff is relatively natural for meeting the needs of a subset of the market:

![Flight Distributions](/images/767e/FlightDistributions.png)

Piano-X gives us a Cd of 0.02527 at cruise based on a reference area of 283.35 square meters.
Because our design uses CFRP, we can make some aerodynamic improvements.
Referencing the 787–8 in Piano-X, we assume the new Cd should be around 0.022 (a 10% improvement).
Taking the 767-300ER in Piano-X and taking a 10% credit on zero-lift drag and leaving induced drag as is, we end up with a Cd around .022-.023 at cruise.
Assuming constant Cd through flight, we can obtain the total work needed to compensate for drag.

# Engines

Making guesses at future engine technology will be key to this analysis and also difficult.
To correctly estimate the needs of the aircraft, we will start with a highly idealized situation and then compare to a slightly more informed approach.
To start, we can assume the engines are perfectly efficient at converting electrical work into kinetic energy of the air and do so in an adiabatic and isenthalpic process:

![Zeroth-order explanation](/images/767e/EngineDiagram.png)

These are some strong assumptions, but we will use a Factor of Safety (or Factor of Ignorance, as one of my instructors in college called it) of 1.25 to compensate.
These assumptions mean that we can convert electricity exactly into momentum of air, and therefore the reaction on the airplane.

This method is simple for basic estimation but the first law of thermodynamics alone doesn't really give us an insight as to what's happening in the stream.
We can look at the upstream conditions and see how we need them to change in the engine to give us the thrust we need.
Neglecting pressure thrust, we can write

$$ T = \dot{m} * (u_e-u_i) $$

Where \\(u_e\\) is the exit velocity, \\(u_i\\) is the inlet velocity, and \\(\dot{m}\\) is the mass flow through the engine.

We don't know the inlet conditions for our airplane, but we can estimate what the engine needs to be rated for in terms of upstream conditions.
The original 767-300ER had an option for GE CF6-80 engines with a rated thrust of roughly 220kN[^12].
If we assume the maximum thrust is available up to 200 m/s, the power transferred to the air would be

$$220\text{kN}*200\text{m/s}=44\text{MW}$$

which seems to agree with the power estimate of 45 MW in the next section.
Assuming each engine needs to produce 45 MW and a thrust of 220 kN, we find that the maximum airspeed at maximum thrust is 205 m/s.

Assuming semi-standard conditions, upstream temperature \\(T_{\infty}=298\text{K}\\), upstream pressure \\(P_{\infty}=101.3\text{kPa}\\), the ratio of specific heats \\(\gamma=1.4\\), and the specific gas constant \\(R=287\text{J/kg-k}\\). 
Taking isentropic relations and calculating the speed of sound upstream \\(a=\sqrt{\gamma*R*T}\\), we find the upstream mach number \\(M_1=.591\\), stagnation temperature \\(T_{t,1}=318.8\text{K}\\), and upstream stagnation pressure \\(P_{t,1}=128.3\text{kPa}\\).
Assuming air at these conditions is an ideal gas, density \\(\rho_1=1.184\text{kg/m^3}\\), and stagnation density \\(\rho_{t,1}=1.402\text{kg/m^3}\\).

Assuming we don't want supersonic exit velocity, we can say we can say \(M_2=0.9\) to reduce engine noise and increase efficiency. 
Unfortunately, we are not adding much heat to the flow so the speed of sound doesn't change much from inlet to exit.
This means that the exit velocity isn't much greater than the freestream velocity so instead a large mass flow is required. 

Assuming an engine efficiency of roughly 95% (5% of electrical work is converted to heat and added to the flow), we find that the temperature increase of the flow is only about 1K when using the resultant mass flow number.

Applying isentropic relations again, we find that 

$$\rho_2=.963\text{kg/m^3}$$$$u_e=u_2=299.3\text{m/s}$$$$\dot{m}=2321.9\text{kg/s}$$

This means that the inlet area \\(A_i=9.58\text{m^2}\\) and the exit area \\(A_e=8.05\text{m^2}\\).
This is an exceptionally large engine, much larger than the original CF-6 due to the lack of heat addition.
It is highly unlikely an engine this large would be able to fit on a 767-style airframe.

An alternative could be installing 4 engines rated at 22.5 MW and 110 kN.
Following the same process, we find all metrics are the same except \\(A_i=4.79\text{m^2}\\) and \\(A_e=4.03\text{m^2}\\), much more reasonable numbers.
More engines may have more benefits: lower risk to the airplane due to engine failure and no ETOPS requirements.

### Engine Weight Calculation

NASA has an ongoing program for lightweight Megawatt-class motors with a target specific capacity of 8 kW/kg and a stretch goal of 16 kW/kg.
Should this technology mature, we can expect the metrics to be a roughly normal distribution with mean 10 kW/kg and standard deviation of 2 kW/kg.

# Putting it all Together

Most flights look relatively the same. Assuming a negative sum of total work rate cannot be recovered (and is therefore 0), we obtain the following:
![Work breakdown](/images/767e/WorkBreakdown.png)
Plotting the maximum work rates and total electrical work done for all flights listed above:
![Work rate averages](/images/767e/WorkRateResult.png)
![Total work](/images/767e/EnergyStorageResult.png)

Applying a Factor of Safety of 1.25 for both energy storage and engine rating, we calculate the airplane must have about 2×45 MW engines or 2×22.5 MW engines and a total storage of 100 MWh.
The weight of the engines will be 4500 kg for two or 2500 kg for four with a standard deviation of 900 kg assuming successful commercialization of NASA’s electric motor technology.
The engines will probably also include some extra weight from the fan, nacelle, etc.
estimated to be on the order of 1500 kg each for two or 1000 kg each for four.
Assuming 220 passengers and our results, the weight of the airplane without batteries should follow this distribution:

![Pre-battery Weight](/images/767e/battery_weight_left.png)

This leaves us with a required battery energy density of 2.2 kWh/kg, well beyond current technology.
To continue the analysis, we will assume this technology exists.

![Battery Density](/images/767e/final_density_result.png)

The actual requirement for energy density may be higher as the batteries may fatigue over time.

# Economic Analysis

It’s clear that our airplane should have a lower recurring cost to airlines compared to existing airplanes due to the change in cost of fuel.
If we target $10,000 in recurring cost reduction per flight cycle and 80% of that value going to the initial purchase price of the airframe, we can estimate with 3 flight cycles / day, 250 operating days in a year, and 15 years of value, our airplane should deliver

\\[ $10000 * 80\\% * 3 * 250 * 15 = $90M \\]

The 767-300 originally sold for roughly $150M in 2020 dollars[^13].
If we assume 30% of that was net profit to Boeing, the cost of the airframe including engines should be $105M.
If our production system would be able to produce net formed, cured, and installed carbon fiber for only $150 more per lb than aluminum, then the new cost to manufacture the electric 767 would be:

\\[ $105M + $150 * 2 * 4000 = $117M \\]

less the cost of engines.
If we assume the engines cost $10M in 2020 dollars, that results in the cost of assembly target of $97M.
By delivering increased value to the airlines, Boeing can charge $240M or $168M after the same margin (now up to $72M/airframe).
This leaves $71M remaining for batteries and engines.
Automotive batteries cost roughly $100/kWh[^14].
If we assume the cost to integrate aerospace-quality battery packs is 5x current automotive prices with no cost decrease over time due to maturation and no cost increase over time due to increased energy density and charging requirements, that prices the total pack at $50M assuming a lifetime of 15 years.
After these are accounted for, there is $21M remaining for the engines.

Assuming 1000 pieces are sold, Boeing would need to limit development spending to $71B to break even; the engine manufacturer would need to provide 2000x 45MW or 4000x 22.5MW pieces at $21B revenue; and the battery manufacturer would need to provide 1000x 100MWh packs for $50B.
Assuming 30% margin for the engine and battery manufacturers, that leaves at most $6.3B for the engine manufacturer and $15B for the battery manufacturer in development spending.
